      <description>To help beginners and other interested in getting acquainted with the classics of tango music, I started putting together Spotify playlists from Stephen Brown&amp;rsquo;s excellent list Classics of Tango Dance Music. This is a work in progress, and it is not all in there. These playlists are all collaborative playlists, and any help is very much appreciated. I got a few Spotify invites to spare, let me know if you need one.</description>
